# There are two terms in the QUBO formulation for graph partitioning on a
# clique. First, we want to minimize the number of links between different
# partitions, and second we want the sizes of the partitions to be the
# same. We handle the first term by favoring links between same
# partitions; this will have the effect of penalizing links between
# partitions, hence minimizing the inter-partition links.
# We accomplish this by putting a negative sign in front of the Lagrange
# parameter in the quadratic term.
# For the second term, we provide biases that favor dividing the nodes into
# the desired number of partitions. We have a choice of how we want to 
# assign the nodes to different partitions. We will fill them in linear 
# order, starting with node 0 into partition 0, node 1 into partition 1, 
# and then start over.
